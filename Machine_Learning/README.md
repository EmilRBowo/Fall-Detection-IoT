## Role Distribution and Contributions

Here is the detailed distribution of roles and contributions for the project:

### 1. *Data Collection and Preprocessing from IoT Sensors:* 

*Asyrafil Nur Azis* and *Moh. Noval Wahyu Aji* are responsible for collecting data from sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and pressure sensors installed on IoT devices. They are also tasked with cleaning raw data to remove noise and applying preprocessing techniques like normalization, encoding, and scaling. High-quality, relevant data is crucial for accurately detecting falls.

### 2. *Design and Development of Machine Learning Models:*

*Emil Reginald Bowo* and *Asyrafil Nur Azis* are responsible for designing various machine learning models such as CNN, regression algorithms, or decision-based classifications. They will test model architectures and regularization techniques to improve performance and find the best solutions for detecting falls from complex data patterns.

### 3. *Model Training:*

*Moh. Noval Wahyu Aji* and *Emil Reginald Bowo* are tasked with using the processed data to train machine learning models. They will set hyperparameters, optimize the training algorithms, and use techniques like cross-validation to prevent overfitting or underfitting.

### 4. *Model Performance Evaluation:*

*Moh. Noval Wahyu Aji* and *Emil Reginald Bowo* are responsible for evaluating the performance of the models using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. They will identify any model weaknesses and make adjustments if needed.

### 5. *Model Implementation on IoT Devices:*

*Emil Reginald Bowo* and *Asyrafil Nur Azis* are responsible for integrating the trained models into IoT devices. They will develop systems that allow the model to communicate with IoT devices and provide real-time responses.

## Project Documentation

All documentation related to the *Machine Learning Capstone Project* can be found in the /documentation folder of this repository. The folder contains:

- *Jupyter Notebook:* A Jupyter Notebook is used to write and execute code for data preprocessing, exploration, and model training in machine learning projects, allowing for interactive analysis and visualization.

- *Dataset:* A dataset is a collection of structured data used for training, validating, and evaluating machine learning models to detect patterns and make predictions.

- *Arduino Code:* Arduino code is used to collect raw sensor data from IoT devices, process it in real-time, and send it to a more powerful computing environment like a Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis.

- *Machine Learning Model:* A machine learning model processes preprocessed sensor data from IoT devices to detect falls, classify activities, and make real-time predictions based on patterns learned from the data.
