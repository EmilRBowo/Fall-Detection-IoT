## Role Distribution and Contributions

Here is the detailed distribution of roles and contributions for the project:

### 1. **Backend Development**

The backend functionality was developed using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**. Its primary purpose was to set up **Firebase** as the core backend service, integrating with the mobile application.

#### Features
1. **Firebase Realtime Database**  
   - Used to store and retrieve data processed by the machine learning model, making it accessible for the mobile app.

2. **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**  
   - Implemented for push notifications, though the feature encountered some challenges.

#### Role in the Project
The mobile application retrieves JSON data from Firebase to deliver fall detection results. The backend serves as the bridge between machine learning data processing and mobile app integration.

### 2. **Repository Management**
- The backend code was uploaded and managed in the **GitHub repository** by **Hadellya Fhiladevya** to ensure version control and streamlined collaboration.

### 3. **Firebase Project Setup**
- The Firebase project setup was performed collaboratively by **Hadellya** and **Anastasia**:
  - **First Attempt**: Configuration failed due to deployment issues.
  - **Second Attempt**: Successfully configured and deployed the project. The project was then shared with all team members.

### 4. **System Architecture Design**
- The **system architecture diagram** was created by **Anastasia Kaunang**, providing a clear visual representation of the project’s workflow and cloud architecture.
